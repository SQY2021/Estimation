Parameter estimation with various nonidealities and uncertainties in a practical circuit is a key but challenging issue in the applications of dual active bridge (DAB) converters for health diagnosis and preventive maintenance. However, most of the existing parameter extraction and identification methods for DAB converters still require a large number of experimental data and expensive measurement costs, while the established estimation model usually lacks generalization. In addition, most of the DAB converter models in previous studies adopt ideal models and ignore circuit nonidealities, which will seriously affect the accuracy and reliability of the models.

[Intelligent methods](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9584587) can effectively mine the rule of data without considering the complex mapping relationship between DAB models and estimated parameters. Consequently, these methods are expected to become the mainstream approach for parameter estimation. This paper proposes a light, flexible, and yet reliable multiparametric estimation algorithm for isolated DAB converters. This approach combines the [back-propagation neural network (BPNN)](https://) and the steady-state [averaged-value model (AVM)](https://) to simultaneously predict the circuit and control parameters of a DAB converter. As a salient role of AI, BPNN possesses tremendous advantages due to its good performance in nonlinear regression, prediction, classification, and data structure exploration. To further optimize BPNN, a genetic algorithm (GA) is employed. The GA-BP-based model was trained and testified by the data from the mathematical model of DAB converter steady-state AVM, so it did not increase any computational. Furthermore, this parameter estimation method reduces the need to build experimental platforms and synchronize measurements. It should be emphasized that DAB modeling takes into account circuit nonidealities, including dead time in the bridges, magnetizing inductance, equivalent series resistances (ESR),  thereby enhancing the accuracy of the model. 

Illustrative results demonstrate that the combined BPNN+GA+AVM model outperforms other existing proposals and is capable of achieving accurate results for both the estimation and prediction of parasitic and control parameters.

## Reduced-order AVM with circuit nonidealities
### Topology of a general DAB converter
For the DAB used as a DC transformer, the input and output voltages are nearly constant, so single-phase-shift (SPS) control is the most widely used one on account of its simplicity and fast dynamic response. Therefore, SPS control is used in this article. The topology of the DAB converter is illustrated in Fig. 1.

### Proposed AVM
The formulation of conventional modeling (both time and frequency domain) is based on the following assumptionsâ€”the circuit does not possess nonidealities and parasitics, such as magnetizing inductance, equivalent series resistances (ESR), and dead times. Compared with traditional modeling of the DAB converter, this paper proposes a reduced-order averaged-value model (AVM) that considers parasitic parameters and the effects of dead-time periods.
- (1) Effects of dead-time periods
  
[1] presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of dead-time effect in the DAB converter. In [1], there are three sub-states of the dead-time effect (boost state, buck state and matching state), and each state has multiple modes. Taking the buck state of the DAB converter as an example, there are 6 modes in total (Fig. 2). We selected the two most typical modes as examples for modeling, and considered parasitism during the modeling process.
