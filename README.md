This is a GitHub repository for the project "[A Novel Estimation Method for Dual Active Bridge Converter Based on Intelligent Algorithm](https://)".

Parameter estimation of dual active bridge (DAB) converters is a powerful tool in the applications of fault location, modulation strategy optimization, and preventive maintenance. However, most of the existing parameter estimation techniques often rely on costly experimental measurements and only estimate some converter parameters. To address these problems, we apply intelligence techniques to propose a flexible, generalized, and reliable multiparametric estimation methodology.
